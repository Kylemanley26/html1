	<h1>Learning Resource Abstract-Computer Science</h1>
	<h3>HTML</h3>
	<p>Initially, i spent time fucking around with html on myspace; i'm sure many people have the same story. Myspace allowed for a person to have a facebook like webpage, but edit it with various "flare" items. Most of these were a simple form of html tags, such as the bold tag or italics. However it allowed for some more in depth functionality, such as the ability to add music to the page or edit the buttons and themes.</p>
	<p>HTML, being a simple language, is best learned through websites such as udemy, bootcamps, project odin, mdn, youtube or codeacademy. Personally speaking i received most of my insights through a paid course on udemy. Of course experience, and hands on practice are the best ways to learn anything aside from my general insights.</p>
	<p> Below you'll find a list of my favourite HTML resources</p>

	<h3>Comptia A+</h3>
	<p>Comptia is the most comprehensive test system for general IT work. Comptia has numerous test that for a small fee one can take, and given a high enough score, can be certified. Comptia isn't a small test system anymore, the canadian and american government both recognize the value of this system and have implemented it into their hiring practices.  Having only taken the A+ exam, my knowledge is limited to that particular skillset. However the holy trio  is generally considered the A+, Security+ and finally Network +.</p>
	<p>The A+ exam mostly consists of two main branches of computer skills, introduction to networking, and introduction to computer hardware. However smaller subsections of the exam are devoted to software, specifically, the installation and management of operating systems.</p>

	<h3>Python</h3>
	<p> Python is widely considered the pre-eminent beginner language. Python's smooth scripting and easy to understand commands are universally easy absorb. Personally speaking i began learning it during a stint of unemployment in the summer of 2016. I quickly banged through a textbook i bought at indigo books. Thus began the rabbit hole that is the tech community, before you know it I was regularly surveying techcrunch, and fully subscribed to the plethora of computer related subreddits. Initially i attempted to use it to data mine at my new sales job, it was OKAY at best. It did return plenty of data from the provincial construction tenders list, however I was often forced to sift for the gold, and help provide a small taste of human accuracy.</p>
	<p> Currently i'm working an entry level position in a tech repair firm, i'm a google authorised technician, a samsung authorised technician and an LG authorised technician. I work with a great group of people that embody the golden archetype, that being, red haired ponytail guy, tall skinny guy (me), small asian guy, and an East Indian. Though this job doesn't use my basic coding abilities at all, it provides plenty of time to learn new techniques and exposes me to the lifestyle and basic IT techniques that any computer guy would be lost without.</p>

	<h3>Enthusiasm/Hobbyist</h3>
	<p> I decided to include this section mostly due to boredom. I think it has alot of value, it provides insight into the newest tech as well as helps one delve further into fringe technology. Most of it is computer hobbyist information, but alot of it has to do with futurology. Certain youtube channels, subreddits and newsites really help me get into the "tech guy life". On that note observe and enjoy.
